# Weighted standard deviation calculation

This function calculates standard deviations with weights and is a
counterpart to the built-in `weighted.mean` function.

## Usage

``` r
wtd.sd(x, weights)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A vector of values for which you want the standard deviation

- weights:

  A vector of weights equal in length to `x`
